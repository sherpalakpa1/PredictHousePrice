# PredictHousePrice
Springboard Capstone Project 2
The dataset for this project is downloaded as a csv file from Kaggle website. This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The data set consists of 21613 observations and 19 features plus the house price and the id columns.

The columns are as follows:-
id: a notation for a house
date: Date house was sold
price: Price is prediction target
bedrooms: Number of Bedrooms
bathrooms: Number of Bathrooms
sqft_living: square footage of the home
sqft_lot: square footage of the lot
floors: total floors (levels) in house
waterfront: House which has a view of a waterfront
view: Has been viewed
condition: How good the condition is (Overall)
grade: overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
sqft_above: square footage of house apart from basement
sqft_basement: square footage of the basement
yr_built: Built Year
yr_renovated: Year when house was renovated
zipcode: zip 
lat: Latitude coordinate
long: Longitude coordinate
sqft_living15: Living room area in 2015(implies -- some renovations) This might or might not have affected the lot size area
sqft_lot15: lot size area in 2015(implies--some renovations)

In this project, I will perform data wrangling to find out any missing data, bad or mistake data, and outliers. Then, I will perform exploratory data analysis and visualization using the dataset to get some insight. Then, I will perform inferential statistics to do hypothesis testing to find out more about the dataset. I would build different machine learning regression models to predict the price of a house, and I will compare them with each other to find out the best model to accurately predict house price.

The deliverables for this project would be a complete presentation of the project with all the documentations, visualizations and python codes on notebook. All the model created to predict house price. The final submission will include the introduction, the steps and methods involved in this project from the beginning to the end of the project. Finally, present how we evaluated the accuracy of different models created, and recommend a model.
